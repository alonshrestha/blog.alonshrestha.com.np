I"D<p>This is my first <a href="https://stechalon.com/register-com-np-domain-free-in-nepal/" target="_blank">blog</a> with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>. I used to have tech-related blogs and online portfolio on WordPress named <a href="https://stechalon.com/" target="_blank">stechalon.com</a> which seems to be very easy for everyone. Having a programming background and using WordPress for blogging was not satisfying for me. First thing, I wanted to have my own custom design web page and second, use my personal domain <em>alonshrestha.com.np</em>. I could have done this using Wordpress or other media donating some money.
Doing research on such media, I came to know about Github Pages and implementing it is the whole output I got here. Thought to share with you guys as working example.</p>
