# Step3: Create Portfolio

Now you will be directed to edit `index.md` page. This page will be the home page of your portfolio. Edit this page by replacing with your content using the same syntax or HTML syntax.

> **Example**

{% highlight ruby %}
  
    Syntax for MarkDown
  
# Heading1 In Markdown
## Heading2 In Markdown
### Heading1 In Markdown

	Syntax for Markup

<h1>Heading1 In Markup</h1>
<h2>Heading2 In Markup</h2>
<h3>Heading3 In Markup</h3>
 
{% endhighlight %}
