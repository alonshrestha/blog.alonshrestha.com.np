# Step3: Create Portfolio

Once you choose a theme, you will be redirected to its ‘index.md’ page. This page will be the homepage of your portfolio. Edit this page with the content suitable with your profile using the same syntax or you can even use the HTML tags.

> **Example**

{% highlight ruby %}
  
    Syntax for MarkDown
  
# Heading1 In Markdown
## Heading2 In Markdown
### Heading1 In Markdown

	Syntax for Markup

<h1>Heading1 In Markup</h1>
<h2>Heading2 In Markup</h2>
<h3>Heading3 In Markup</h3>
 
{% endhighlight %}
