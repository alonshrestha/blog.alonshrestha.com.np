This is my first [blog](https://stechalon.com/register-com-np-domain-free-in-nepal/){:target="_blank"} with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}. I used to have tech-related blogs and online portfolio on WordPress named [stechalon.com](https://stechalon.com/){:target="_blank"} which seems to be very easy for everyone. Having a programming background and using WordPress for blogging was not satisfying for me. First thing, I wanted to have my own custom design web page and second, use my personal domain _alonshrestha.com.np_. I could have done this using Wordpress or other media donating some money.
Doing research on such media, I came to know about Github Pages and implementing it is the whole output I got here. Thought to share with you guys as working example.

I choose Github Pages and Jekyll for hosting my pages and didn't believe the secret that [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} is the king when it comes to blog and hosting.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} is a markdown language used for generating a static page and Github Pages is the static page hosting media. If you are posting on different media this helps you to migrate your blogs without any cost and lost in Github Pages.

## Using Github Pages
#### Pros
- [Free of cost](#)
- [Security and Reliability](#)
- [Use Custom Domain](#)
- [Custom Theme](#)
- [Fast because of a static page](#)
- [No Database](#)

#### Cons
- [Programming and GitHub knowledge are required](#)
