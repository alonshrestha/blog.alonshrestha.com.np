Domain **.com.np** is the property that you can get in Nepal for free. Did you believe it? If you didn't, I will make this real for you.

[.np](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.np){:target="_blank"} is the country top-level domain in Nepal administered by [Mercantile Communications Pvt. Ltd.](http://mos.com.np/){:target="_blank"} Registration of .np with secondary level like **.com.np**, **edu.np**, **org.np** can be registered by **Neplease**, **Non-Resident Neplease** and even by the **foreigners** having Neplease residential.  

You can have your personal name domain representing your brand, organization, service, etc. I have used my name as domain ([alonshrestha.com.np](http://alonshrestha.com.np/){:target="_blank"}) for my personal and blog. Follow the procedure below if you need one.
